         <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a
             ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games
              since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996. The adapted version of volleyball at the
               Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.The complete set of rules is extensive,but play essentially proceeds as
                follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a
                 hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The 
                 receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to three times to return 
                 the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.</p>
